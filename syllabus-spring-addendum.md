# **Computer Science Fundamentals: Spring Syllabus Addendum**

We did much good work this fall. You have seen all the basic building blocks of
programming twice: once in Scratch and a second time in Java. You're able to
write non-trivial Java programs that solve problems. Your technical
communication skills have developed meaningfully. Not terrible for a semester.

But we moved slower than I'd expected us to. The problem sets were too
infrequent; the temptation to "get help" without exercising your critical
faculties -- to get a meal without having learned to fish -- was too great. The
lectures were less effective than I'd wish.

So this spring will be a soft reset. We'll use some new resources and
restructure assignments. There will be more opportunities to practice, to work
at your own pace, and to take responsibility for your own learning. We'll
retrace some ground, but we'll also move much faster.

## **"Textbook"**

You will be working through the lessons from the University of Illinois'
introductory computer science course. They are available at
[learncs.online](https://learncs.online). You will need to create an account.

## **Assignments**

You will keep a notebook this semester. For every lesson, you will take notes
and answer questions. These lesson reviews are **required** but not graded. I
will check them weekly for adequacy: I will give you informal feedback on their
quality, but not thoroughly check each for accuracy and completeness. To be
_adequate_, your lesson reviews must demonstrate to me a deep engagement with
the material and a genuine effort to master it.

As you progress through the lessons, you will take checkpoint assessments. To
qualify to attempt a checkpoint, you must have completed all the preceding
lesson reviews. To complete a checkpoint, you must get a perfect score.
Checkpoints may be repeated as many times as needed. The goal is to demonstrate
mastery, not memorize answers. Thus I may substitute or modify questions as I
see fit and without notice.

You will take a **midterm** at the end of the third quarter and a **final** at
the end of the fourth quarter. To prepare for each, you will take a practice
exam and we will review it together.

## **Grades**

Grades will be assigned according to the Northridge grading scale and comprised
of the following:

| Component    | Weight |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Checkpoints  | 80%    |
| Midterm Exam | 10%    |
| Final Exam   | 10%    |
