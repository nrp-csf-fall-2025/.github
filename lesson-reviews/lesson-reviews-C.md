# Lesson Reviews - Part C (Lessons 33 - 60) 

This quarter, there are no preset questions to answer. I've only listed what I
judge to be key topics. Notebook checks will continue, but it's up to **you** to
write your own questions and answer them. It's still a good practice to ask
questions about code examples or include code examples in your answers.
