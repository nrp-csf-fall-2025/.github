Fall 2025 & Spring 2026 (v. 1.0.0)  
Dr. Nicholas Kruckenberg (nkruckenberg@northridgeprep.org)

## **Course Description**

Computer Science Fundamentals is a college-level introduction to computer science and computational thinking. Students will learn foundational programming concepts and techniques using the Java programming language. All content necessary for the AP Computer Science A exam is covered in detail.

## **Goals**

You will:

1. become a proficient Java programmer.   
2. use code as a tool for solving problems.  
3. be introduced to fundamental topics in computer science.  
4. learn to communicate technical concepts and decisions to technical and non-technical audiences.  
5. be well prepared for the AP CS A exam (whether or not you choose to take it).

## **The Plan**

We’ll spend most of our time designing, writing and analyzing Java programs.

**Fall Semester**

1. Elements of Programming  
   *variables, assignment statements, built-in data types, control flow (conditionals and loops), arrays, input & output*  
2. Functions and Modules

*modularization, program design*

**Spring Semester**

1. Object Oriented Programming  
   *classes and class instances (objects), comparison with procedural and functional programming*  
2. Algorithms and Data Structures  
   *sorting and searching algorithms, fundamental data structures (stacks, queues, hash tables)*

## **Textbook**

*Introduction to Programming in Java \- An Interdisciplinary Approach (2nd Edition)*  
Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne

## **Grades**

Grades will be assigned according to the Northridge grading scale and comprised of the following:

| Component | Weight | Approximate Frequency |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Problem sets | 50% | every week or two |
| Tests | 30% | every two or three weeks |
| Final exam | 20% | once per semester |

## **Responsibilities**

It is your responsibility to:

* submit assignments on time. Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day. (Extenuating circumstances will be handled individually.)  
* consult the course log and get notes and announcements from a classmate if you’re absent.  
* work diligently in class. While in-class assignments are ungraded, they will prepare you for problem sets, tests, and exams.  
* be resourceful and persevering. It pays to sit with a problem. Form and test hypotheses, consult the textbook and other sources, debug your programs, read the docs, but ***don’t give up*** and ***don’t wait for someone else to solve your problems***.

## **Responsible Use of Technology**

Follow the Computer and Network Technology policy in the student handbook. If you need to hide your screen, switch tabs or windows, or clear your browser history, you're falling short of the mark.

## **Use of Artificial Intelligence**

AI is already a widely-adopted productivity tool in software development. We will practice using AI as a *learning* tool, exploring ways it can help and hinder those learning to code.
